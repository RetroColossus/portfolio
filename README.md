# Porfolio Project

  ### This is a starter portfolio project where I experimented with Flexbox, Media Queries, and Google Developer Tools

  ## Code used: HTLM and CSS

  ## Experimented with Flexbox

   * used Flexbox in containers and container-items
   * adjusted flexbox for media queries

  ## Experimented with Media Queries

   * used media queries to adjust portfolio for different screen sizes
   * added different elements and values for trial and error
  

  ## Experimented with Google developer tools

   * used Google developer tools to resize screen according to viewport
   * used developer tools for "what ifs"
